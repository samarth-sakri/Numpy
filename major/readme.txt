🧮 NumPy Mathematical Calculator

A Python-based mathematical calculator built using the NumPy library. This project performs basic arithmetic, statistical analysis, and array manipulation through an interactive interface — ideal for students learning NumPy fundamentals and real-world numerical computing.

🎯 Objective

To build a Python-based calculator using NumPy that performs:

Basic arithmetic operations

Statistical analysis

Array manipulation

This project helps users understand how NumPy is used in real-world numerical computing tasks.

✨ Key Features
1️⃣ Basic Arithmetic Operations

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Power operations between two arrays

2️⃣ Statistical Operations

Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Variance

Minimum, Maximum, Sum, Product

Shape, Size, and Data Type detection

3️⃣ Array Manipulation

Reshaping arrays (when possible)

Sorting and Reverse Sorting

Unique value extraction

Accessing first and last elements

Filtering values greater than the mean
